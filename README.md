# Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) in C++

This repository contains an implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm in C++. MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm used for decision-making processes, particularly in game playing and planning.

## Features

- Implementation of the MCTS algorithm in C++
- Easy to integrate with various game environments
- Configurable parameters for exploration and simulation
